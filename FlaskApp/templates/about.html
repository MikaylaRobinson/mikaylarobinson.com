                    I co-parent tgit his sweet girl. After moving into our apartment, my partner found her crying,
                    starving, and dirty on the street. After a trip to the vet and countless cans of cat food, she
                    has turned into a happy and healthy cat. She now goes by KitKat and spends her days finding new
                    places to nap around the house.

                    My dog, Lillee, has been a dedicated best friend for many years. It was a tough decision, but
                    she stayed back at my parents' house where she has a big yard, dogs to play with, and constant
                    supervision.

                    I am a December 2018 graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University. I graduated with a major in Zoology
                    and a minor in Spanish. My major taught me major biological functions while applying the
                    scientific method and practicing laboratory techniques. In undergraduate sciences, the focus is
                    largely on data collection. After learning how to collect quality data, my interest is now
                    learning the tools to analyze it!

                    Originally from Ohio, I grew up in a rural, farming community. Most people do not know, but
                    llamas can be useful as guard animals due to their pack instinct and intimidating size.
                    This is Letigo, and he acts as the guard for his "pack" of goats and chickens. He is still
                    in Ohio warding off the occasional coyote,fox, or raccoon.
