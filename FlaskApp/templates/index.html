            <p>Welcome to my website! Follow along as I explore topics in data science and technology. This blog
                will highlight my personal side projects as well as include informational posts about new topics.
                As I tackle new topics, my posts will demonstrate my learning process to serve as a studying
                tool for myself and hopefully for others that want to make the jump into learning about this field.
